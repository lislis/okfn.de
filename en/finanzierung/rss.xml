      <description>Personnel costs are by far the largest expense item. Our excellent team is our most important resource. In addition, non-personnel costs as well as tax payments are incurred every year. Most of the expenditure is project-related. We try to keep the administrative costs of the organization low (approx. 5% of the total expenditure). They include, for example, material costs for rent, finances, insurances and technical infrastructure.
This year, OKF employs an average of 28 people, many of them part-time.</description>

      <description>The majority (65%) of our income comes from project-related grants. In addition, there is growing donation income amounting to approximately 21% of our income. Most of the donations are addressed to FragDenStaat. Additionally, the charity campaign FriendlyFirecontributed to this increase of donations by raising donations for the OKF as a wholeas well as for 7 other organizations in December 2019. Furthermore, we generated about 13% of our income from economic income sources.</description>
